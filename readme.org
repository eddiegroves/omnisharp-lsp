* OmniSharp LSP installer

Helps install the [[https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn][omnisharp LSP]] by:

1. Remove any existing version in current directory.
2. Download and unzip latest release of =omnisharp-roslyn=.

Editors (in my case, Emacs with lsp-mode) need to be configured to point to
=omnisharp-roslyn= directory.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq lsp-csharp-server-install-dir "/path/to/omnisharp-roslyn-lsp")
#+end_src

** Usage

Using [[https://github.com/TekWizely/run][run]]:

#+begin_src sh
run install
#+end_src

The [[file:Runfile][install script]] is very simple and could be manully run step-by-step.
